### What we did

Here is a list of things I could do during the community bolding period :

	<li>Got myself the title of a Red Hen. Look for me <a target="_blank" href = "https://sites.google.com/site/distributedlittleredhen/home/profiles-of-red-hen-participants">here</a>, and find out which Red Hen are you <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA5CuN7YJdM&feature=youtu.be">here</a> </li>
	<li>Bonded with the Red Hen Lab community. </li> Got to know a lot of new people who have worked for Red Hen in a direct or indirect way, which help me understand the working paradigms as well as the functioning of already existing research. Because without that :

<ol start='2'>
	<li> Started with setting up an RPi Digital video recording station. Oh I love hardware, and specially when you get recognized to use it. </li>
	<li> Pushed 250 commits to different repos (including <a href = "https://github.com/SoumitraAgarwal/BlendedJointAttention">blended classical attention</a> for Red Hen Lab) in a week. By far the best Open Source week I have had.</li>
	<li> Set up a personal <a target = "_blank" href = "soumitraagarwal.github.io">blog</a>, which should be updated here and there sometime later. <i>Don't procrastinate</i> . Okay I am doing it. :unamused: </li>
	<li> Set up this record of updates, for my Google summer of code project </li>
	<li> Though about the odds which would favour an upside down mermaid. <i>Not the correct place Soumitra</i>. Ohh, nevermind :sweat_smile: </li>
</ol>
