	<li> Pushed 250 commits to different repos (including <a href = "https://github.com/SoumitraAgarwal/BlendedJointAttention">blended classical attention</a> for Red Hen Lab) in a week. By far the best Open Source week I have had.</li>
	<li> Set up a personal <a href = "http://soumitraagarwal.github.io/">blog</a>, which should be updated here and there sometime later. <i>Don't procrastinate</i> . Okay I am doing it. :unamused: </li>
	<li> Set up this record of updates, for my Google summer of code project </li>
	<li> Though about the odds which would favour an upside down mermaid. <i>Not the correct place Soumitra</i>. Ohh, nevermind :sweat_smile: </li>
</ol>
