The packets were looked up, ordered, dispatched and recieved with a little hassle here and there.

Setting up wasn't so tough either. Though without the proper HD Homerun tuner, we cannot actually record the television, but we can be sure of the fact that we can once we recieve it. 

### The setup

Started as this :

Now we are here :

<figure class = "half">

	<img src="{{ site.url }}/img/g.jpg">
</figure>

Just in case someone is wondering, or if you have read so far, this obviously in not a complete setup. But soon will be. Any suggestions on tuners for a HDHomerun in India are welcome.

###### Cheers!
