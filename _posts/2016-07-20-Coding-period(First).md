### Initial stages

I was expected to do the following as part of the `Google Summer of Code` period :

* Unsupervised learning mechanism to separate out clips with different instances of blended classical joint attention.

* Manually annotating the clips segregated (with ELAN) and finding out different elements that would contribute to different classes of BCJA.

* Identifying the co-speech gestures that I have planned using already known
classifiers.

* Build our own classifier using manual as well as feedback from the earlier known
classifier, thus improving it altogether.

* Testing our classifier and error correction.

* Gesture and micro-expression detection using data-sets of highly expressive

anchors as data-sets.

* Scene continuity and change detection.

Since there are a lot of people working, there is a lot which is common across different proposals. So the work-flow changes more often than not. Thus, when the coding period began, what I needed to do to make a significant contribution to the organisation was very different that what I had proposed. Before the mid-term I was working on the `Red-Hen Lab` repository [BlendedClassicJointAttention](https://github.com/RedHenLab/BlendedJointAttention)
