### Creating a Raspberry Pi DVR setup

Contributions to an open source organisations might be related to development, design etc. When your mentors send you a Raspberry Pi to set up a digital TV recording station in India, you know you are up to something serious.

The packes were looked up, ordered, dispatched and recieved with a little hassle here and there.

Setting up wasn't so tough either. Though without the proper HD Homerun tuner, we cannot actually record the television, but we can be sure of the fact that we can once we recieve it.
